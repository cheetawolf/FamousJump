# FamousJump
A Pygame Zero project I self-taught and completed in 3 days while I was bored in the hospital. Here is the outcome. Its not actually the best, looking back 1 year later hehe. 
FamousJump is a platformer game featuring famous celebrities jumping up the various challenges as the game progresses because it is funny. Who doesn't want to see the Queen jumping up some stairs?!
