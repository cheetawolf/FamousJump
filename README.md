# FamousJump

### Completed: September 2020

# About
A Pygame Zero project I self-taught and completed in 3 days while I was bored in the hospital. Here is the outcome.
FamousJump is a platformer game featuring famous celebrities jumping up the various challenges as the game progresses because it is funny. Who doesn't want to see the Queen jumping up some stairs?!

# Usage 
```bash
pip install pgzero
```
```bash
pgzrun src_2024.py
```

# Author's note in 2023
Back then I was not taught anything about OOP or object exports. Therefore this program is heavily sequential and therefore is many times longer than it should be. However I feel that preserving this code is important so that I can look back to where I was learning. 
Game design is not my thing but hopefully I will create a better project in future when I have the time

Pgzero sucks because I am forced to use global variables
I love arguments and parameters!!!!!!!!!!!
